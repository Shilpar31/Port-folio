                <h3>Research Project: AI-ML Models with Fuzzy Logic for Mining Safety</h3>
                <p>
                    Integrated ML models with fuzzy logic to enhance safety measures in mining operations.
                    Created predictive systems for hazard detection, improving risk assessment accuracy.
                    Conducted experiments and analysis to validate the effectiveness of the developed models
                    <br /> Technologies Used: Python, Jupyter

                <h3>Q&A chatbot-RAG Project</h3>
                <p>
                   This project is a PDF-based Q&A app using LangChain, Ollama, Streamlit, and ChromaDB. Users upload a PDF via Streamlit, which is split into chunks and embedded as vectors. 
                    These embeddings are stored in ChromaDB for similarity search. When a question is asked, the most relevant chunks are retrieved and passed to a local LLM via Ollama. 
                    The generated answer is then displayed to the user in the interface.
